# Getting Started with Create React App

# Description

I created a movie search application using React.js and API. I wanted to create a tool that would allow users to easily search for their favorite movies and discover new ones.

To get started, I used create-react-app to set up my project and installed the necessary dependencies, including Axios to make API calls.

Next, I created a search bar component where users could enter the name of the movie they were looking for. When the user submits their query, the application makes an API call to a movie database to fetch the relevant data, such as the title, poster image, release date, and genre. I used conditional rendering to display the search results on the screen.

To make the application more user-friendly, I added a loading spinner to indicate when the application was fetching data from the API.

Finally, I used Netlify to deploy my movie search application online so that users could access it from anywhere. 

As a developer, I enjoyed creating a movie search application that makes it easy for users to find their favorite movies and discover new ones. I look forward to enhancing the application with additional features and making it even more useful for movie lovers everywhere.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
